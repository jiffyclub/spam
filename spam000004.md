for more. We are aware that a lot of foreigners out there have been deceived
and lost their hard earn money to these fraudsters after promising them
percentages in their letters/e-mails for their impending help to move funds out
from Africa including fake lottery winning notification and at the end of the
day, they will collect thousands of dollars from them without a successful end.
